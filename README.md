# Memory Card Game
The game tests the player's memory and concentration skills, as they need to remember the positions of previously flipped cards in order to make successful matches. The challenge lies in remembering the images on the cards and using that information to make strategic decisions on which cards to flip.

# How to Play:
The game board consists of twelve cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of six different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. 
      * The player will click on any card to reveal its symbol.
      * The player will then click on another card to reveal its symbol.
      * If the symbols on the two cards match, they will remain face-up.
      * If the symbols on the two cards do not match, they will be flipped back over.
      * Your goal is to match all the pairs of cards on the board.
      * The game is over when all pairs are matched or when time runs out.
      * Try to complete the game by matching pairs quickly.
